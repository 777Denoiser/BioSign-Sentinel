# Bio: Cyberpunk-Inspired Pathfinding Daemon ACO Solver

## Jacking into the Bionet Maze:

**Welcome to Bio-Sign Sentinel, where swarms of digital ants navigate the neon-lit corridors of data to solve complex routing problems. This project implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to tackle the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a cyberpunk twist.**

**In the neon-lit sprawl of our digital future, BioSign Sentinel emerges as a cutting-edge pathfinding daemon. Utilizing the bio-inspired Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, this tool navigates the complex networks of Neo-Kyoto and Cyber-Detroit or (Neo-{insert your city}) with unparalleled efficiency.**

**In the sprawling megacities of tomorrow, where neon bleeds into the night and corporate AIs rule the datascape, your health is your most precious commodity. BioSign Sentinel isn't just software – it's your first line of defense against the viral threats lurking in the shadows of Neo-Kyoto and the back alleys of Cyber-Detroit.**

**This rapid symptom analysis daemon is designed to flag potential COVID-19 or COVID-32 infections before they compromise your system. Don't trust the corp-sponsored clinics or back-alley ripperdocs – arm yourself with data and stay one step ahead of the pandemic.**


## Core Modules:

1. **ACOAlgorithm.cpp/.h**: The neural network of our digital ants, implemented in C++ for blazing speed. The neural core of our digital ant swarm, coded in C++ for maximum processing speed.
   
2. **Main.java**: The command center GUI, bridging the gap between user and machine. The cyberspace interface, bridging wetware and software through a Java-based GUI.
   
3. **visualize.py**: Our augmented reality display, rendering optimized paths in vivid detail. Our augmented reality module, rendering optimized paths using Python's matplotlib and networkx.
   
4. **generate_data.py**: The matrix architect, spawning vast cityscapes for our ants to explore. The virtual cityscape architect, generating vast datasets for our pathfinding swarms.
